| Layer         | Description |

| **File Storage** | Local or cloud-based (AWS S3/Cloudinary) for images. |
| **Testing**   | Unit + integration tests (e.g., Pytest or Postman for API tests). |
| **Logging**   | Global error handling and logging middleware. |
| **Security**  | Encrypted data, rate-limiting, and secure credentials handling. |
| **Performance** | Caching with Redis and optimized SQL queries. |
